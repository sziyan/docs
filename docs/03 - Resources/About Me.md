# About Me
![[../pikachu-bubbletea.jpg|300]]


Hello! Welcome to my digital garden.

I am a Cloud Engineer from Singapore 🇸🇬 who is interested in various technologies from Smart home to self hosting, to containerisation. I enjoy tinkering and problem solving.

Some of my interests in no particular order:
	
- Self hosting
- Apple products
- Products with seamless integration
- Smart home and automation
- Discovering productivity apps that improve my daily workflow

This site serve as a knowledge bank to all my encounters in both my professional and personal life.

## Details of this site

- Notes are created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and pushed to GitHub with [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin
- Site is hosted in Netlify.

I regularly post in my own [micro blogging site](https://memos.punydev.me) where I share things that are too tech related for my general [Mastodon friends](https://kopiti.am/@punydev)
